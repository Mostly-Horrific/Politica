# Politica
Something I have wanted to make for a long time (Yep that is purposely vauge)

#Running Politica

You can do this many ways but for the mean time there is no release package, so you need to down the source code unzip it to a directory of your choosing. 

Stick it on a http server or use a virtual http server and away you go. 

#Contributions

Not really accepting contributions of any kind at the moment, I want to get this into some sort of direction first before I am ready for input.
